//Object-Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real-world, making the code short and easier to
// understand.
//With the help of OOPs, we try to implement real-world entities such as object, inheritance, abstraction, etc.
//OOPs helps us to follow the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) approach of programming, which in turn increases the
// reusability of the code.



//    Two most important aspects of OOPs - Classes & Objects :
/*
Class :
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.
It is a logical component.

Objects :
An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template (info) is defined.
Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
It is a physical entity.


We identify the following:

Noun              - Class                        - Employee
Adjective        - Attributes                  - name, age, salary
Verb               - Methods                    - getSalary(), increment()

OOPS TERMINOLOGY
Abstraction-
    Hiding Internal Details

Encapsulation-
    In java , encapsulation means hiding the sensitive data from users

Inheritance-
    The act of deriving new things from existing things

Polymorphism-
    One entity, Many forms
